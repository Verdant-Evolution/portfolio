X-Ray beamline scientists have unique challenges when it comes to positioning of samples. Often they need to know where something is in space to within a single micron. While 6DoF arms present significant flexibility, they often do not have the necessary accuracy. This project involved 
1. Writing custom drivers for a Kuka arm so we can control it through the ROS2 control framework.
2. Developing and validating high precision inverse kinematics and path planning.
3. Creating a driver for a 1-D Keyence laser to provide visual feedback to the system.
4. Designing a process that would maximize accuracy and minimize the time taken to achieve it.

The result is a system that can position a sample in an X-Ray beamline to within 50 microns of the desired position.
