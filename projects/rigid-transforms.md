# Rigid Transforms

The hardest thing about performing spatial operations is transforming between many reference frames. This small Python library encapsulates all of the necessary operations on rigid transformations $T\in SE3$ from basic constructions, to representation transformations, to parallel transport and Kabsch registration.
