# Generative Behavior Generation

Its very hard to program a robot. One reason is that the algorithms are difficult and subtle. Another reason is that the interfaces are complex and unnatural. Using generative AI models at the core of a program synthesis engine, we developed an augmented reality based, bidirectional communication interface that allows users to give commands to a robot while sharing the same space. Users can point to things, draw outlines, and use hand gestures to communicate direction to a robotic system. The AI can then examine the low level tools it has at its disposal and come up with a way to perform the presented task.
